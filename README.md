# Design Hub Website
The first iteration of Pitt's Design Hub website. Design Hub is about students building solutions to real-world problems in and around the University of Pittsburgh. We are driven by design principles and strive for interdisciplinary collaboration and hands-on experiences. Get in touch at hi@pittdesignhub.com.

This website is open-source (license TBD). Design Hub logo designed by Madhur Malhotra.
